# Keras Autoencoder

A collection of different autoencoder types in Keras. It is inspired by [this blog post](http://blog.keras.io/building-autoencoders-in-keras.html).

## Installation

Python is easiest to use with a virtual environment. All packages are sandboxed in a local folder so that they do not interfere nor pollute the global installation:

    virtualenv venv
    
Whenever you now want to use this package, type
    
    source venv/bin/activate
    
in every terminal that wants to make use of it. To install the dependencies, use **pip**:
    
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
Now everything is ready for use!

## Usage

One can change the type of autoencoder in **main.py**.

    python main.py
